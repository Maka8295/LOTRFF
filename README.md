My final project for CS50P, a text-based turn-based RPG set in Middle Earth with Final Fantasy themes (because I am very original). Focus has been put on coding the working parts rather than balance, so it may be too easy, random, or too hard in parts!

Features:

Ability to make a party of up to 4 characters each with a race, job and name. Race and job will affect your characters stats and abilities. Hidden abilities and stat boosts exist for certain combinations of names, races and jobs!

Turn based combat with healing / buff items, physical and magical attacks, and blocking. Enemies will drop gil.

Levelling up system in which XP earned from encounters will level up your characters and increase their stats.

Ability to rest at campsites to restore HP and MP.
